# roblox-mass-group-game-downloader
Download all games from a roblox group easily. 

# how it works
only non-native python library used is "requests", you can install easily by running `pip install requests`

simply run, enter your roblox cookie and the group id and all games will be downloaded in to the "games" folder 

# safety
the script only contacts official roblox endpoints and wont store your cookie or any data, but if you wanna be safe you can look through the code (good on you for being cautious)
